# Building This Portfolio with Claude Code

## Overview

This portfolio was built collaboratively using Claude Code, demonstrating practical AI integration in professional work.

## The Process

[Add details about how the portfolio was developed]

## Documentation Approach

For every project, write a detailed FORHARSH.md file that explains the whole project in plain language.

Explain the technical architecture, the structure of the codebase and how the various parts are connected, the technologies used, why we made these technical decisions, and lessons I can learn from it (this should include the bugs we ran into and how we fixed them, potential pitfalls and how to avoid them in the future, new technologies used, how good engineers think and work, best practices, etc).

It should be very engaging to read; don't make it sound like boring technical documentation/textbook. Where appropriate, use analogies and anecdotes to make it more understandable and memorable.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- Tailwind CSS (via CDN)
- Claude Code for AI-assisted development
